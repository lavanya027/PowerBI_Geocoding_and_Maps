#Geocoding and Maps using Power BI

**The following project depicts a way in which we can get the latitudes and longitudes of a data by giving city as a input and can then use it to create visualization using Bubble Maps.** Using latitude and longitude also removes ambiguity of locations and can return results more quickly.

For this **Bing Maps** is used. However when visualizing data in a map, it’s important to understand what data is sent to external services such as Bing Maps for geocoding purposes, especially if your data is sensitive. It may be helpful to know that using latitude and longitude with the standard bubble map does not send data to Bing Maps. 

Following is the overview of steps used in the project

•	Imported data from an open source database data.world and transformed it to meet the requirements.
•	Created a Custom Function and then column which pulled Latitude and Longitude data from Bing Maps.  
•	Created a Data Visualization Report to show distribution of sales across geography with the help of Bubble Map.
